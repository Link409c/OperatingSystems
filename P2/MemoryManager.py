# Project 2
# The Memory Manager
# Christian Simpson
##
# This program emulates the different memory management schemes in Operating Systems which allocate
# system memory to user jobs, programs, and processes.
#
# Pseudocode for the program:
#
# The Program should
# Process a list of jobs and their memory costs
# create a list of jobs in order of their submission
# allocate memory in different ways
#   Best-Fit
#   First-Fit
# the program should keep several lists:
#   submitted jobs
#   memory partitions
#   which job is at what partition
#   working jobs
#   completed jobs
# the program should adjust memory segments using compaction.
# the program should print the lists to a file?
# the program should print some type of results for the user?
