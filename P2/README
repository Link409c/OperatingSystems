This is the instructional guide for Project 2: The Memory Allocation Emulator.

The program's purpose is to illustrate the different ways in which a single-user
operating system allocates, manages, and assigns memory to different jobs or programs
loaded into the system.

The user should pass a file to the arguments when running the program that contains
the necessary memory needed to run the programs, sizes of the memory partitions, and job names / sizes.

Example:

150000
70000, 20000, 50000, 10000
Job 1, 10000
Job 2, 50000
Job 3, 75000
Job 4, 25000
Job 5, 30000

The program will parse the input and create lists the functions will follow to
illustrate how memory allocation would handle the jobs.
