This is the instructional guide for Project 2: The Memory Allocation Emulator.

The program's purpose is to illustrate the different ways in which a single-user
operating system allocates, manages, and assigns memory to different jobs or programs
loaded into the system.

The user should pass a file to the arguments when running the program that contains
job / process names and the necessary memory needed to run the programs.

Example:

Job 1, 10k
Job 2, 50k
Job 3, 75k
Job 4, 25k

The program will parse the input and create a list the functions will follow to
illustrate how memory allocation would handle the jobs.
