This is the instructional guide for Project 2: The Memory Allocation Emulator.

The program's purpose is to illustrate the different ways in which a single-user
operating system allocates, manages, and assigns memory to different jobs or programs
loaded into the system.

The user should pass a file to the arguments when running the program that contains
the following:
line 1: total memory allocated for all partitions.
line 2: sizes of the memory partitions, equaling the total.
line 3 - end: each job consisting of job name and memory required.

Example:

150000
70000, 20000, 50000, 10000
Job 1, 10000
Job 2, 50000
Job 3, 75000
Job 4, 25000
Job 5, 30000

To begin, download the file "MemoryManager.py" to a suitable directory if not already located on your device.

Next, ensure the parameters file "mmparams" is located in the same directory as the program.

Then, check that you have Python installed by opening the Terminal and typing the command:

    python

If not, navigate to Python.com using your web browser to download and install the latest version.

Once that is complete, open a new Terminal.

Navigate to the directory containing the file, "MemoryManager.py".

To run the program, type the command:

    python MemoryManager.py mmparams

Hit the ENTER key to start the program.

The program will parse the input and create lists the functions will follow to
illustrate how memory allocation would handle the jobs.

Currently, First Fit algorithm is available for testing purposes.

Current Known Bugs: list indexing for compaction fails after first successful function call.
