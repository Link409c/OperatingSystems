# From Flynn & McHoes 8th ed.
# Pg 139 Exercise 19
# Write a program that will simulate FCFS, SJN, SRT, and round robin
# scheduling algorithms. For each algorithm, the program should compute waiting
# time and turnaround time for every job, as well as the average waiting time
# and average turnaround time. The average values should be consolidated in a
# table for easy comparison. You may use the following data to test your program.
# The time quantum for the round robin is 4 ms. (Assume that the context switching time is 0).
