This is the instruction manual for Project 3: The Page Manager.

This project is designed to simulate page fault handling in an operating system.

The user will pass a file to the args array of the program, formatted like so:

2
1000
2000
3000
500
200

The first number is the amount of frames to use (2 through 5).
The second number and onwards is each job's required memory.

To run the program:

Navigate to the directory containing the file, "PageManager.py".

Ensure your input file is located in the same directory for ease of use.

To run the program, type the command:

    python PageManager.py arg1

where arg1 is your filename.

The program will create a number of frames, split each job into pages, and create
Page Management Tables for each job.

The user will be prompted to input a replacement algorithm acronym to run the jobs.

Please choose "FIFO" or "LRU" at this time. Any other input will cause the program to close.

The program will then run each job and document the number of interrupts that occur.

Page Replacement will be handled according to the chosen replacement algorithm.

The program will inform the user of the results after completing every job.

Note the steps generated for each job are random, so run times and interrupt counts will vary.
